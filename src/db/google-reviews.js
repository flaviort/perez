		review: "In the years that I have been going to Perez Chiropractic I have had nothing short of greatness. The staff are always very attentive and courteous. Their professional demeanor is the best. Dr. Perez should be proud of what they bring to the table every day. Dr Perez is one of the best. She was able to ge the back to health and without pain quicker and better than any one else. Also was able to help my own body sustain itself by her corrective measures. I highly recommend Perez Chiropractic & Well was for any of your needs."
