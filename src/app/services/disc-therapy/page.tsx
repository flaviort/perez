									How it works
								</h2>

								<p>
									Since its release, clinical studies have revealed an amazing success rate in treating spinal disc related problems with Spinal Decompression. By using technology that allows the spine to distract through gentle force, we are able to relieve nerve compression often associated with low back pain, sciatica, and stenosis.

									Fun Facts:
								</h2>

								<ul className='ul'>

									<li>
										There are 33 total vertebrae in the spine andÂ the first chiropractic adjustment was performed Sept 18th, 1895.
									</li>

									<li>
										Less than 10% of your nervous system perceives pain, the other 90% is responsible for allowing your body to function properly; it is possible to have nerve interference and feel perfectly healthy. How you feel is a poor way to judge your health. By the time symptoms appear, many spinal problems are advanced.
									</li>

									<li>
										Every pound we are overweight is 4 extra pounds of stress on our weight bearing joint like our spine, knee, and hips.
